                <p>A pastor had a kitten that climbed up a tree in his backyard and then was afraid to come down. The
                    pastor coaxed, offered warm milk, etc. The kitty would not come down.</p>
                <p>The tree was not sturdy enough to climb, so the pastor decided that if he tied a rope to his car
                    and drove away so that the tree bent down, he could then reach up and get the kitten.</p>
                <p>He did all this, checking his progress in the car frequently, then figured if he went just a little
                    bit further, the tree would be bent sufficiently for him to reach the kitten. But as he moved a
                    little further forward, the rope broke.</p>
                <p> The tree went "boing!" and the kitten instantly sailed through the air - out of sight.</p>
                <p>The pastor felt terrible.</p>
                <p>He walked all over the neighborhood asking people if they'd seen a little kitten. No. Nobody had
                    seen a stray kitten. So he prayed, "Lord, I just commit this kitten to your keeping," and went on
                    about his business.</p>
                <p>A few days later he was at the grocery store and met one of his church members. He happened to look
                    into her shopping cart and was amazed to see cat food. Now this woman was a cat hater and everyone
                    knew it, so he asked her, "Why are you buying cat food when you hate cats so much?"
                </p>
                <p>She replied, "You won't believe this," and told him how her little girl had been begging her for a
                    cat, but she kept refusing. Then a few days before, the child had begged again, so the Mom finally
                    told her little girl, "Well if God gives you a cat, I'll let you keep it!"</p>
                <p> She told the pastor, "I watched my child go out in the yard, get on her knees, and ask God for a
                    cat. And really, Pastor, you won't believe this, but I saw it with my own eyes.</p>
                <p> A kitten suddenly came flying out of the blue sky, with its paws outspread, and landed right in
                    front of her."</p>
